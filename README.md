# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Using-Soft-Margin-and-Multiclass-SVM

This Project contains soft margin SVM using linear and nonlinear kernels. And also contains the computation and formulation for different types of linear and non -linear SVMâ€™s and usage linear kernel and RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel for the classification of the non-linearly separable data (. i.e., Real world datasets).
This also contains the computation in MATLAB to observe the working of linear and nonlinear soft margin SVMs. It contains the formulation of soft margin SVM as a constrained optimization problems in Primal, dual and Matrix forms. This also contains the implementation of SVM over breast cancer dataset (Real world data).
